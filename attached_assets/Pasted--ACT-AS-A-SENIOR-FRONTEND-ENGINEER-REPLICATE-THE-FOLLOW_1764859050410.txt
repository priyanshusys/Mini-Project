# ACT AS A SENIOR FRONTEND ENGINEER. REPLICATE THE FOLLOWING PROJECT.

## Project Title: JobManage Pro (Job Management Portal)
**Tech Stack:** React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons, Recharts, SheetJS (XLSX), Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`).
**Data Persistence:** LocalStorage (simulate a backend).

---

## 1. DESIGN SYSTEM & THEME
- **Primary Theme:** "Pitch Dark" Mode.
  - Dark Mode Backgrounds: `bg-black` (Main), `bg-zinc-900` (Surface/Cards).
  - Light Mode Backgrounds: `bg-zinc-50` (Main), `bg-white` (Surface).
  - Primary Color: Blue (`text-blue-500`, `bg-blue-600`).
  - Text: `text-zinc-100` (Dark), `text-zinc-900` (Light).
- **Layout:** Responsive Sidebar (left) + Header (top) + Main Content Area.
- **Icons:** Use `lucide-react` for all iconography.

## 2. USER ROLES & PERMISSIONS
The system has three distinct roles. Implement strict visibility rules:

### A. Admin ("System Owner")
- **Access:** Full access to Dashboard, Job Board, Team Management, and "Previous Contributors".
- **Team Management:**
  - Can view ALL users.
  - Can Create, Edit (Name, Phone, Role), and Soft Delete users.
  - **Restriction:** Cannot edit Salary or Rating.
  - **Exclusive Feature:** Can view "Previous Contributors" (deleted users) and **Restore** them.
- **Job Management:** Can create, edit, delete, and verify any job.

### B. Supervisor ("Manager")
- **Access:** Dashboard, Job Board, Team Management.
- **Team Management:**
  - **Visibility:** Can ONLY see Employees. Cannot see Admins or other Supervisors.
  - **Editing:** Can ONLY edit **Salary** and **Rating** (1-5 Stars). Cannot edit Name/Phone.
- **Job Management:** Can create jobs, assign them to employees, and verify completion.

### C. Employee ("Worker")
- **Access:** Dashboard, My Jobs.
- **Team Management:** No access.
- **Job Management:** Can only view jobs assigned to their ID. Can change status from PENDING -> IN_PROGRESS -> SUBMITTED. Cannot "Verify" jobs.

## 3. CORE FEATURES & LOGIC

### A. Authentication (Login/Signup)
- **Login:** Username/Password. Check `isDeleted` flag; if true, deny login with error "Account terminated".
- **Sign Up:** 
  - Provide 3 distinct buttons/options: "Sign up as Employee", "Sign up as Manager", "Sign up as Admin".
  - Default Salaries: Supervisor ($60k), Employee ($45k).
  - Default Rating: 5 stars.
  - **Important:** Do NOT show a list of demo accounts/passwords on the login screen.

### B. Dashboard
- **Charts:** Use `recharts` to show a bar chart of Job Status Distribution.
- **Metrics (Role Based):**
  - **Employee:** Total Jobs, Pending, In Progress, Completed.
  - **Admin/Supervisor:** Total System Jobs, Pending Review (Submitted but not Verified), Assigned by Me, Avg Completion Time (Hours).

### C. Job Board (Kanban/List)
- **Data Model:** Title, Description, AssignedTo (User ID), Status, DueDate, AI Generated Description.
- **Statuses:** `PENDING`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `SUBMITTED`, `VERIFIED`.
- **AI Integration:** Use `@google/genai` model `gemini-2.5-flash` to generate a 3-sentence professional job description based on the Title.
- **Termination Handling:** If an assigned user is soft-deleted, the job card must show the user's name with a **"(Terminated)"** warning in red.

### D. Team Management
- **Excel Import:** Allow Admin to upload `.xlsx` files to bulk create users (fields: username, fullName, phone, salary).
- **Soft Delete:**
  - Deleting a user sets `isDeleted: true`.
  - They disappear from the main list but appear in the Admin's "Previous Contributors" view.
  - Their history (jobs completed) remains intact in the database.

## 4. FILE STRUCTURE & IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### `types.ts`
Define interfaces for `User` (include `isDeleted`, `salary`, `rating`) and `Job`. Define Enums for `UserRole` and `JobStatus`.

### `services/storageService.ts`
- Implement a wrapper around `localStorage`.
- **Seed Data:** Initialize with 1 Admin, 1 Supervisor, 2 Employees, and 1 Soft-Deleted Employee if storage is empty.

### `services/geminiService.ts`
- Initialize `GoogleGenAI` with `process.env.API_KEY` (or `import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY` if using Vite).
- Function `generateJobDescription(title)` returns a string.

### `components/Layout.tsx`
- Handle Sidebar navigation.
- Dark/Light mode toggle switch in Header.

### `App.tsx`
- Handle Routing (view state).
- Manage global state (`users`, `jobs`, `currentUser`).
- Render Login/Signup view if `!currentUser`.
